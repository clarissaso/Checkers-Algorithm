# **Checkers-Algorithm**

Checkers, or draughts, is a strategy board game played by two players. There are many variants of checkers. Your task is to implement a program that reads, prints, and plays our variant of the game.

Figure 1: Example board configurations, moves, and captures.

**Setup.** An 8x8 chessboard with 12 black and 12 white pieces initially positioned as shown in Figure 1a.

**Gameplay.** Each player plays all pieces of the same color. Black open the game by making a move, then white make a move, and then players alternate their turns. In a single turn, the player either makes a move or capture. For example, the arrow in Figure 1a denotes an opening move of the black piece from cell G6 to cell F5.

**Moves.** A piece may move to an empty cell diagonally forward (toward the opponent; north for black and south for white) one square. The arrows in Figure 1b show all the legal moves of black and white pieces.
Towers. When a piece reaches the furthest row (the top row for black and the bottom row for white), it becomes a tower (a pile of pieces). The only move of the white piece at cell D7 in Figure 1b promotes it to the tower. A tower may move to an empty cell diagonally, both forward and backward, one square. The arrows in Figure 1c show all the legal moves of black and white towers.

**Captures.** To capture a piece or a tower of the opponent, a piece or a tower of the player jumps over it and lands in a straight diagonal line on the other side. This landing cell must be empty. When a piece or tower is captured, it is removed from the board. Only one piece or tower may be captured in a single jump, and, in our variant of the game, only one jump is allowed in a single turn. Hence, if another capture is available after the first jump, it cannot be taken in this turn. Also, in our variant of the game, if a player can make a move or a capture, they may decide which of the two to complete. A piece always jumps forward (toward the opponent), while a tower can jump forward and backward. The arrows in Figure 1d show all the legal captures for both players.

**Game end.** A player wins the game if it is the opponentâ€™s turn and they cannot take action, move or capture, either because no their pieces and towers are left on the board or because no legal move or capture is possible.
